            <p>Getting away for a week or weekend with the Lean Motherfuckers team, to boost your company and transform your idea into a working
                prototype.</p>
            <p>We are religious about the idea that working hard is only possible if you also play hard, and we feel like we found the best way to
                combine those two: we rent a villa in the middle of nowhere, making sure there is a pool and a jacuzzi, enough beer, wine and energy
                drinks, and a team full of energy, to build an awesome prototype in the shortest amount of time possible.</p>

            <h3 class="title">The Line Up</h3>
            <p>Our team has created a total of 15+ startups, gave advice to dozens more, and work with the newest techniques in development,
                marketing, sales and running a lean business. They are each motherfucking power houses individually, but form a team that can do more
                in a single week than most teams will be able to do in a month.</p>

                    <h4 class="title">The Hustler &ndash; Bart Temme</h4>
                    <p>The connective tissue of the group. He knows marketing and sales, but most of all he knows people. Bart has given workshops in
                        schools all over the Netherlands, works with governmental organisations all over Europe, and has helped release a couple of
                        rap records in his spare time. </p>
                    <p>Talk with Bart for an afternoon, and he’ll provide you with a singular vision for your company or project, as well as helping
                        you set up a baseline for your business plan, marketing strategy and online presence.</p>

                    <p>Ever met a serial entrepreneur? This guy has started a handful of companies before reaching the legal drinking age, one of
                        which is now a global Google partner, another is taking over the education market in the Netherlands.</p>
                    <p>Did we mention he is also a techie that knows everything about mobile and web development, security and IoT? Thomas started
                        programming at age 11, and hasn't stopped learning new technologies and languages since, but most importantly knows how to
                        problem solve like nobody else.</p>

                    <h4 class="title">The Hipster &ndash; Dante van der Heijden</h4>
                    <p>Design is in Dante’s blood. Like, literally. I don't think you've ever met a family that is as artistic as his. He was featured
                        as one of the "25 best entrepreneurs under 25" in the Netherlands and gave his first TED talk at age 16.</p>
                    <p>It doesn't even matter whether it’s app design, branding or the marketing materials for your next big event, Dante does it all.
                        And when it comes to apps, his talents don't stop at the design stage: he also builds iPhone apps in his spare time.</p>

                <div class="team-member-inner">
                    <h4 class="title">The Hacker &ndash; Ahsan Fazal</h4>
                    <p>Ahsan has a youthful enthusiasm that’s just absurd - in a awesome way! Once he gets excited about an idea, he won't sleep until
                        a first prototype is finished, whether it's an app, website, or something totally different.</p>
                    <p>The dude’s a full stack developer, as well as studying to become a real-life rocket scientist. And then there's all the
                        blockchain stuff he's working on. Only ask him about it if you have a few hours of spare time though :)</p>
